LINUX QUESTIONS:

What is hardlink and softlink

Hard Link :

A hard link acts as a copy (mirrored) of the selected file. It accesses the data available in the original file.
If the earlier selected file is deleted, the hard link to the file will still contain the data of that file.
# Command to create a hard link is: $ ln  [original filename] [link name]

Soft Link :

A soft link (also known as a Symbolic link) acts as a pointer or a reference to the file name. 
It does not access the data available in the original file. If the earlier file is deleted, 
the soft link will be pointing to a file that does not exist anymore.
# Command to create a Soft link is: $ ln  -s [original filename] [link name] 


Comparison                      Hard link                                                         Soft link
Parameters	
               	                                                       
Inode number*	  Files that are hard linkedtake the same inode number.	      Files that are soft linked take a different inode number.

Directories      	Hard links are not allowed for directories.               Soft links can be used for linking directories.          
                      (Only a superuser* can do it)	                                         

File system      	It cannot be used across file systems                     It can be used across file systems.

Data	              Data present in the original file will still be available    Soft links only point to the file name, it does not retain
                    in the hard links                                            data of the file.

Original file’s      If the original file is removed, the link                       If the original file is removed, the link
deletion	         will still work as it accesses the data the                    will not work as it doesn’t access the original file’s data.
                    original was having access to

Speed	                 Hard links are comparatively faster.	                       Soft links are comparatively slower.
